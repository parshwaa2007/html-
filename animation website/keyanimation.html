<h2>Key animation </h2>
<p>Now we start animating!!</p>
</div>
</header>

<p><b>After the <a href="storyboarding.html"><mark>Storyboarding</mark></a> is done</b>,the storyboards are then given to the <b><mark>Key animator.</mark></b>


<h3 style="border:3px solid Tomato">Now what is Key Animation??</h3>

<p>Key Animation is the development of <mark>Key Frames</mark>.Key frames are basically the starting and the ending point of the animation.<br>
So the stating point of a animation would have a keyframe thend point would have a key frame ,and the betwwen point of the action would have a frame that is known as <mark>break-in pose</mark></p>
	
<h3>Here we have:</h3>

<p>The starting point(key frame):
<img src="images/ka1.jpg" alt="key frame" width="192px" height="108px"></img>

The midpoint(break-in frame/s):
<img src="images/b1.jpg" alt="breakin pose" width="192px" height="108px"></img>
<img src="images/br2.jpg" alt="brakin pose" width="192px" height="108px"></img><br>

The end point(key frame):
<img src="images/ka2.jpg" alt="key frame" width="192px" height="108px"></img>

The actual animation:
<img src="images/withanti.gif" alt="animation" width="192px" height="108px"></img>

</p>

<h3 style="border:3px solid Tomato">Features of key animation:</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is used to show the flow of the animation.</li>
<li>It has the starting point and ending point of the animation so it helps to lay out the chracter movemnt</li>
<li>The key animtor has to do less work the the <a href="#" >inbetweeners</a>since he has to the start and end the betwwen pose,nonethe leess it is hard work!!</li>
<li>It helps in the porduction cause the key animation and <a href="#">inbettweening</a> can go simontaniously,hence producting more cuts of animation. </li>
</ul>


<h3 style="border:3px solid Tomato">Example:</h3>
<h4>Here we have a cut from <a href="https://youtu.be/sUw477ZseNg">Chaos:An Independent Animation Project</a>
<p>This cuts key-animation and inbettweening was done by <mark>Me</mark> and was corrected by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProbablyPretentious/featured">Probably Pretnecious(director)</a></p>
<p><sup>We will talk about inbetwwening and corrections later</sup></p>

<h3>The keyframes:</h3>
<img src="images/k1.jpg" width="300px" height="169px"></img>
<img src="images/k2.jpg" width="300px" height="169px"></img>
<img src="images/k3.jpg" width="300px" height="169px"></img>
<img src="images/k4.jpg" width="300px" height="169px"></img>
<br>

<h2>The finished cut:</h2>

<video width="500" controls>
	<source src="vidoes/cut 7.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	
	<p>Can you notice all the keyframes in this cut??</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Also you might wonder that the final cut looks a lot diffrent than only the key frames and that because keyanimation isn't the only process of animation ,<br>
	After key animation there are multiple other processes to finish the cut such as:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>corrections</li><br>
	<li>2nd key animation(optional)</li><br>
	<li>inbetwweening</li><br>
	<li>backgrounds(3D camera mapping in our case)</li><br>
	<li>and compositing</li><br>
	</ul>
	
	<p><sup>We are going to talk about all these in detail in coming chapter</p>
	
	

<h3 style="border:3px solid Tomato">What about the "Creative freedom" of the animtor??</h3>

<p>IF you have been paying attention than you may notice that the key animtor has to make the key animation out of the storyboard,<br>
So what about the creative freedom of the animtor,does he have to strictly follow the storyboard,isn't that just glorified slavery??since he can' do anthing out of the box due to lack of good storyboard??</p>

<p>A simple answer to that would be :</p>
<h4>NO</h4>


<p>Animators are allowed to deviate from the story board till it represents the same thing intended in the storyboard:</p>

<h3>Some thimes the animtor just deviate slightly :</h3>

	<source src="vidoes/cut 7.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<h3>Or the may deviate from it quite a bit till the director allows it:</h3>

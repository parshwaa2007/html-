			<div class="col-sm-4"><!--Squash and stretch-->
			<h3>1)Squash and Stretch</h3>
			<P>Squash and Stretch is one of the most important priciple of animation.<br>
			 it gives the illusion of the object being animated having mass and being affected by gravity.</p>
			<p>One of the best examples of squash and stretch could be the ball we made ,
			when the ball goes up or comes down its is streached showing thst it has mass and is falling fast,<br>

			<p>when the ball hits the ground it is squashed showing that the gravity is affecting it.</p>

		<h3>2)Anticipation</h3>
		<p>Anicipation is when you prepare berfore the action</p>
		<p>for example: when a person bends before he jumps,if a person didn't bend thier knees befor jumping would look quite unnatural</P>
		<p>So by using Anicipation we prepare the audience before the action</P>
		<br>
		<p>Here is a example of a clip <mark>without anticipation:</mark></p>
		<img src="images/noanti.gif" alt="without anticipation" width="240px" height="144px"></img>
		<br>
		<p>The last clip was fine as is <sup>but</sup>after <mark>adding</mark> in some <mark>anticipation</mark> it looks more life like</p>
		<img src="images/withanti.gif" alt="with anticipation"  width="240px" height="144px"></img>
		<br>
		<p>Here is the anticipation frame/pose we added ,as you see its just a single frame but it makes a lot of diffrence</p>
		<img src="images/aniti.jpg" alt="anticipation" width="240px" height="144px"></img>
		<p><mark>Note</mark>:<mark>this anticipation pose right here is the chracter bending her knees before launching forward into the action</mark></p>
		
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="col-sm-4"><!--staging-->
		<h3>3)Staging</h3>
		<P>Staging is not only a animation principle but also applies to live action movies and tv shows</p>
		<P>staging refers to draw the viewers attention to the main element of your animation<br>
		thats why it is also applicable to live action cause it there you also have to <mark>draw the viewers eye to your subject</mark></p>
		<p> Here we have two examoles of staging</P><br>
		<p>if you were given to draw a scene where a interviewer asks super hero a question while audience cheer for him nwhich one would you draw??</P>
		<br>
		<img src="images/nostg.jpg" alt="no staging" width="240px" height="144px"></img>
		<P>In the example above it hard to focus on our main subject thatis the superhero,everything feels cluttred and you can't focus</P>
		<br>
		<img src="images/wstg.jpg" alt="with staging" width="240px" height="144px"></img>
		<p>while here in the above example we can clarly thee sthe hero,the interviewer and the audience,you can clearly see the diffrence your self!</P>
